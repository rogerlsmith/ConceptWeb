        <h1>This is a help document for the concept app</h1>
        <p>There was never a formal name given to this project, it was simply a "concept" idea and that is how the project began.  It will get a cool name in the near future.</p>
        <p>After installing the app you are presented with 3 basic options: Record, Publish and Browse.  In essence, the app is an audio recorder that publishes the recordings to a server for anyone (at this time) to listen to.  It is pretty straight forward, press Record to record, Publish to send it to the server and browse to see and listen to all of the existing recordings.</p>
        <p>When you first click on Record, it opens a recording tool that displays a picture of a microphone.  This picture also has a Record button, press it and you will see the audio being recorded.  Untouched, the screen will not turn off and the app will continue to record audio.  If you turn the screen off, it will stop recording audio.  Press the Stop button to stop recording and press the "back" button on your phone to go back to the main 3 option menu.</p>
        <p>Once a recording has been published, it is available for listening on the app as well as through my website.</p>
        <p>Be careful what you publish, there is no way for you to remove it!  Just keep this in mind.  :) </P>
    Cheers!
